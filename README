This is an implentation by RootSecks of Robert "RSnake" Hansen's
SlowLoris attack tool (bit.ly/1R6TKDO) using
multiple tor proxies locally to obfuscate the attacker.

I have made a minor and rather crude modification to restrict
the use of this to onion only addresses.

Mitigation notes for Apache server admins:
1/ Install reqTimeout mod to mitigate this attack
2/ Since this is an Onion ( therefore localhost/127.0.0.1 ) only attack variant, do not use ModQoS or any other IP based module
